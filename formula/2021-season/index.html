<h2 id="2021-season-analysis">2021 Season Analysis</h2>
<p>This season was filled with thrilling moments as six different drivers claimed victories, most of them starting from the front row. Notable triumphs included <strong>Esteban Ocon</strong>’s impressive win from P8 in the <strong>Hungarian Grand Prix</strong>, and <strong>Lewis Hamilton</strong>’s spectacular performance starting from P10 in the <strong>Brazilian GP</strong>. <strong>Max Verstappen</strong> and <strong>Lewis Hamilton</strong> engaged in a captivating rivalry, securing 10 and 8 wins, respectively. <strong>Sergio Perez</strong> added to the excitement with his second career win, while <strong>Ocon</strong>’s victory was aided by <strong>Fernando Alonso</strong>’s masterful defense against <strong>Hamilton</strong>. <strong>Daniel Ricciardo</strong>’s triumph in <strong>Monza</strong> was historic for <strong>McLaren</strong>, marking their first win in nine years and a long-awaited 1-2 finish, ending their drought since 2010. This season showcased the fierce competition and unpredictability that defines Formula 1, with drivers displaying their skill and determination from various starting positions.</p>
<figure class="my-8 text-center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mpalaourg/F1_DataAnalysis/main/2021-Season/imgs/race_winners.png" alt="2021 race winners" class="mx-auto"/><figcaption class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-slate-400"><p>Race winners of the 2021 Formula 1 season.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The podium is the ultimate reward for drivers, allowing them to celebrate their hard work and that of their teams. Analyzing the image below, it becomes evident that <strong>Max Verstappen</strong> and <strong>Lewis Hamilton</strong> dominated the season with 18 and 17 podium finishes, respectively. Notably, <strong>George Russell</strong> achieved his first ever Formula 1 podium during the <strong>Belgian Grand Prix</strong>, while the return of two-time world champion <strong>Fernando Alonso</strong> to the podium in the <strong>Qatar GP</strong> was a significant moment.</p>
<figure class="my-8 text-center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mpalaourg/F1_DataAnalysis/main/2021-Season/imgs/podium_finishes.png" alt="2021 podium finishes" class="mx-auto"/><figcaption class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-slate-400"><p>Podium finishes per driver in the 2021 season.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Securing points by finishing within the top-10 is a significant milestone for both drivers and teams throughout the race weekend. Remarkably, every driver, excluding the <strong>Haas</strong> rookies <strong>Mick Schumacher</strong> and <strong>Nikita Mazepin</strong>, managed to score at least one point this season. <strong>Lewis Hamilton, Lando Norris</strong>, and <strong>Carlos Sainz</strong> emerged as the top point finishers across various tracks, accumulating a combined total of 20 point finishes, closely followed by <strong>Max Verstappen</strong> with 19. <strong>Verstappen</strong>’s teammate <strong>Sergio Perez</strong> consistently finished in the top-10, achieving this feat 16 times, while <strong>Charles Leclerc</strong> found himself sandwiched between the two <strong>Red Bull</strong> drivers with 18. At the other end of the spectrum, <strong>George Russell</strong> and <strong>Kimi Räikkönen</strong> led the charge for <strong>Williams</strong> and <strong>Alfa Romeo</strong> respectively, as their teams secured points in several races.</p>
<figure class="my-8 text-center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mpalaourg/F1_DataAnalysis/main/2021-Season/imgs/point_finishes.png" alt="2021 point finishes" class="mx-auto"/><figcaption class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-slate-400"><p>Points-scoring finishes per driver in the 2021 season.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the newest features introduced in the 2021 Formula 1 season was Sprint Qualifying. This format involved a qualifying session on Friday that determined the grid for the Sprint Qualifying, with the result of the latter determining the starting grid for the Sunday race session. Three Sprint weekends took place at <strong>Silverstone, Monza</strong>, and <strong>São Paulo</strong>, where drivers finishing in the top-3 were awarded 3, 2, and 1 point respectively.</p>
<p>Based on the provided visualization, only five drivers reaped the benefits of the Sprint Qualifying sessions. Both <strong>Valtteri Bottas</strong> and <strong>Max Verstappen</strong> earned 7 points, while <strong>Lewis Hamilton</strong> managed to secure only 2. <strong>Daniel Ricciardo</strong> and <strong>Carlos Sainz</strong> were the other drivers who scored, albeit limited to a single point each. A particularly attention-grabbing moment occurred in Brazil when <strong>Hamilton</strong> started the Sprint Qualifying from the back of the grid but made a remarkable climb through the positions in the 24-lap race, ultimately finishing in 5th place. This performance was crucial for <strong>Hamilton</strong> to keep the championship title competition alive against <strong>Verstappen</strong>. However, <strong>Hamilton</strong>’s Sprint Qualifying success was marred by a subsequent 5-place grid penalty for the main race due to the use of an additional power unit element.</p>
<figure class="my-8 text-center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mpalaourg/F1_DataAnalysis/main/2021-Season/imgs/sprint_points.png" alt="2021 sprint points" class="mx-auto"/><figcaption class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-slate-400"><p>Points earned from Sprint Qualifying sessions in 2021.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to the fastest drivers on the track, it is no surprise that <strong>Lewis Hamilton</strong> and <strong>Max Verstappen</strong> dominated once again, each securing six fastest laps. <strong>Valtteri Bottas</strong> and <strong>Sergio Perez</strong> followed closely behind with four and two fastest laps respectively. Additionally, <strong>Daniel Ricciardo, Lando Norris</strong>, and <strong>Pierre Gasly</strong> each achieved this feat once during the season, adding the accomplishment of being <em>the fastest driver</em> to their careers.</p>

<p>In the world of Formula 1, retirements are an inevitable part of the sport, whether due to mistakes or mechanical issues. Throughout the 2021 season, a total of 59 DNFs were recorded. Among these, 6 were attributed to accidents, while 20 were a result of collisions between drivers. The remaining retirements were caused by mechanical issues, most commonly involving gearboxes, brakes, or engine failures. Notably, <strong>Nikita Mazepin</strong> and <strong>George Russell</strong> experienced the highest number of retirements, both with six each. <strong>Max Verstappen</strong> faced three DNFs, including a high-speed tire blowout in the <strong>Azerbaijan Grand Prix</strong>, a collision with <strong>Lewis Hamilton</strong> at <strong>Silverstone</strong> resulting in a dramatic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIKel6jVD3Q">51G crash</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VSwwZYDW94">another collision with <strong>Hamilton</strong></a> at the <strong>Italian Grand Prix</strong>. Despite these three retirements, <strong>Verstappen</strong> achieved an impressive 18 podium finishes in the 19 races he completed, demonstrating his remarkable consistency in securing top-three results whenever he reached the finish line. Interestingly, the <strong>Italian Grand Prix</strong> incident also marked the only retirement for <strong>Hamilton</strong> throughout the season. Notably absent from the figure provided is <strong>Carlos Sainz</strong> from <strong>Ferrari</strong>, who impressively completed all the races in the 2021 season without a single retirement.</p>

<h2 id="point-progression">Point Progression</h2>
<p>A thorough analysis of the drivers’ points throughout the season reveals an intense battle between <strong>Max Verstappen</strong> and <strong>Lewis Hamilton</strong>, as they consistently outperformed the other drivers and established themselves as the frontrunners. Following behind them in the driver standings are their respective teammates, <strong>Valtteri Bottas</strong> and <strong>Sergio Perez</strong>. <strong>Charles Leclerc, Lando Norris</strong>, and <strong>Carlos Sainz</strong> engaged in a closely contested competition, with their positions in the standings neck-and-neck until the final race. Ultimately, <strong>Sainz</strong> secured the fifth place, establishing himself as the best-of-the-rest among the drivers outside of <strong>Mersedes</strong> and <strong>Red Bull</strong> lineups.</p>
<figure class="my-8 text-center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mpalaourg/F1_DataAnalysis/main/2021-Season/imgs/points_progression_drivers.png" alt="2021 drivers points progression" class="mx-auto"/><figcaption class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-slate-400"><p>Drivers’ championship points progression throughout 2021.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Taking a closer look at the intense rivalry between <strong>Max Verstappen</strong> and <strong>Lewis Hamilton</strong>, the championship lead exchanged hands a remarkable five times throughout the 2021 season, setting the stage for a thrilling finale. In the final race, with both drivers tied on points, a late Safety Car incident prompted <strong>Verstappen</strong> to pit for fresh soft tires, while <strong>Hamilton</strong> chose to stay out. With just one lap remaining, <strong>Verstappen</strong> made a decisive move in turn 5, successfully overtaking <strong>Hamilton</strong> and securing his first World Championship title. However, the final laps were not without controversy, as <strong>Mercedes</strong> appealed the race result due to incidents and contentious decisions made by the FIA. Despite the appeal, no result was ultimately reached, solidifying <strong>Verstappen</strong>’s well-earned championship victory.</p>

<p>Shifting our focus to the Constructors’ Championship, it was a closely fought battle between <strong>Mercedes</strong> and <strong>Red Bull</strong> throughout the season. However, in the end, <strong>Mercedes</strong> emerged victorious, securing their remarkable 8th consecutive title. <strong>Ferrari</strong>, after a disastrous previous season, made a strong comeback in 2021, surpassing <strong>McLaren</strong> in a closely contested clash for the third-place position in the Constructors’ standings. Their improved performance showcased their determination and ability to bounce back from setbacks.</p>
