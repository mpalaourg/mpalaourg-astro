Surprisingly, <strong>Mercedes</strong> failed to meet expectations, struggling to maintain their dominant form. As a result, the battle for supremacy shifted between <strong>Red Bull</strong> and <strong>Scuderia Ferrari</strong>. However, <strong>Ferrari</strong>’s performance was marred by numerous mistakes, particularly in terms of strategy, revealing an area of weakness for the team. This allowed <strong>Red Bull</strong> and their driver <strong>Max Verstappen</strong> to seize control and secure both the Constructors’ and Driver World Championship titles with relative ease in the second half of the season.</p>
<h2 id="race-calendar">Race Calendar</h2>
<p>As displayed below, the 2022 Formula 1 season boasted an exhilarating race calendar comprising 22 races in 20 countries. Noteworthy inclusions were the return of the <strong>Australian, Canadian, Japanese</strong>, and <strong>Singapore Grands Prix</strong> after a two-year hiatus caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, certain races, such as the <strong>Portuguese, Styrian</strong>, and <strong>Turkish Grands Prix</strong>, were not part of the 2022 lineup. The <strong>Qatar Grand Prix</strong> also did not feature, with plans for its return in 2023. COVID-19 restrictions led to the cancellation of the <strong>Chinese Grand Prix</strong> for another year. The <strong>Russian Grand Prix</strong> faced initial suspension due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and was subsequently canceled. On a more positive note, the debut of the <strong>Miami Grand Prix</strong> added further excitement to the championship, offering fans a fresh and thrilling addition to the race calendar.</p>

<figure class="my-8 text-center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mpalaourg/F1_DataAnalysis/main/2022-Season/imgs/podium_finishes.png" alt="2022 podium finishes" class="mx-auto"/><figcaption class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-slate-400"><p>Podium finishes per driver in the 2022 season.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Upon examining the point finishes, it becomes clear that <strong>Max Verstappen</strong> and <strong>George Russell</strong> were the most consistent drivers, both securing 20 point finishes. They were closely followed by their respective teammates, <strong>Sergio Perez</strong> and <strong>Lewis Hamilton</strong>, as well as <strong>Charles Leclerc</strong>. <strong>Lando Norris</strong> had an exceptional season with 17 point finishes, showcasing his strong performances while his teammate <strong>Daniel Ricciardo</strong> faced struggles. <strong>Alpine</strong>’s <strong>Esteban Ocon</strong> and <strong>Fernando Alonso</strong> capitalized on the team’s well-designed car, establishing themselves as the best from the second-tier teams in 2022.

<p>The F1 Sprint format made its return for the 2022 championship, maintaining the same weekend structure as in 2021. The sprints were held at <strong>Imola</strong>, the <strong>Red Bull Ring</strong>, and <strong>Interlagos</strong>, with a notable change being the awarding of points to the top eight finishers instead of just the top three as in the previous year. As depicted below, this new scoring system allowed more drivers to benefit from the F1 Sprint sessions. <strong>Max Verstappen</strong> continued to excel, topping the charts with an additional 21 points from the sprint races. <strong>Carlos Sainz</strong> and <strong>Charles Leclerc</strong> put in strong performances, closely following <strong>Verstappen</strong>. <strong>Sergio Perez</strong> and <strong>George Russell</strong> also secured extra points through the sprint sessions, showcasing their abilities in these shorter races. The increased number of point-earning opportunities in the F1 Sprint format added an extra dynamic to the championship.</p>

<p>The opportunity to score an extra point for the fastest lap during a race session was once again present in the 2022 season, provided the driver finished inside the top 10. <strong>Max Verstappen</strong> continued to showcase his speed and skill, topping the charts with 5 points for the fastest laps. In <strong>Singapore</strong>, <strong>George Russell</strong> finished in P14, missing out on the additional point, while <strong>Zhou Guanyu</strong> in <strong>Japan</strong> finished in 16th place, also unable to secure the fastest lap point. Notably, <strong>Verstappen</strong> and <strong>Russell</strong> achieved a maximum of 34 points in a race weekend at the <strong>Emilia Romagna</strong> and <strong>São Paulo Grand Prix</strong>. This exceptional feat was accomplished by winning the F1 Sprint session, the race itself, and scoring the fastest lap, further highlighting their outstanding performances and ability to maximize their points haul.</p>

<p>In the realm of Formula 1, retirements are an inevitable aspect of the sport, resulting from mistakes or mechanical issues. Throughout the 2022 season, a total of 74 DNFs were recorded. Among these, eight were attributed to accidents, while ten stemmed from collisions between drivers. The remaining retirements were a consequence of various mechanical issues, notably involving gearboxes, hydraulics, power units, or engine failures. <strong>Carlos Sainz</strong> endured the highest number of retirements with six, a notable contrast to his flawless record of completing all races in the 2021 season. <strong>Valtteri Bottas, Fernando Alonso</strong>, and <strong>Yuki Tsunoda</strong> also faced six retirements each, revealing reliability issues for <strong>Alfa Romeo, Alpine</strong>, and <strong>AlphaTauri</strong>. Both <strong>Williams</strong> drivers, as well as <strong>Zhou Guanyu</strong> and <strong>Kevin Magnussen</strong>, also encountered challenges leading to retirements, exposing issues within their respective teams. One of <strong>Zhou</strong>’s retirements was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7kjjkh2lmM">horrific accident at <strong>Silverstone</strong></a> following contact with <strong>George Russell</strong>’s <strong>Mercedes</strong>, serving as a stark reminder of the risks and incidents that can occur on the track.</p>

<h2 id="point-progression">Point Progression</h2>
<p>Upon closer examination of the drivers’ points throughout the season, it becomes evident that <strong>Charles Leclerc</strong> initially led the World Championship until the 6th race, where <strong>Max Verstappen</strong> overtook him in the standings and went on to secure his second consecutive World Championship title. <strong>Leclerc</strong>’s hopes for the championship dwindled as the season progressed, hampered by strategic mistakes from <strong>Ferrari</strong> and personal errors on track. In the latter half of the season, <strong>Leclerc</strong> found himself locked in a battle for second place with <strong>Sergio Perez</strong>, ultimately emerging victorious in the final race of the season. <strong>George Russell</strong> had an impressive debut year with <strong>Mercedes</strong>, even managing to outperform <strong>Lewis Hamilton</strong> on the standings. Notably, <strong>Hamilton</strong> attempted a late-season comeback, but it was <strong>Carlos Sainz</strong> from <strong>Ferrari</strong> who claimed the fifth-place position in the championship standings.</p>
