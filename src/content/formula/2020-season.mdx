The 2020 Formula 1 season was significantly impacted by the global spread of the
Covid‑19 virus. The season, originally scheduled to begin in March, was postponed
for several months until July. The first eight rounds of the Championship were
held without spectators, and the remaining races were either run with limited
capacity or behind closed doors due to the second wave of the pandemic.

## Race Calendar

The season witnessed several significant developments. The **Australian Grand
Prix**, scheduled to be the season opener, was canceled just hours before the
first FP session. Other notable cancellations included the **Vietnam Grand Prix
at Hanoi Street Circuit** and the **Netherlands Grand Prix at Zandvoort**, which
was set to return after a hiatus of more than 30 years.

Initially, the calendar featured eight European tracks, but as time progressed,
more circuits were added. New venues such as **Mugello (Tuscany GP)** and
**Algarve (Portugal GP)** made their debut, while iconic circuits like
**Nürburgring**, **Imola**, and **Istanbul Park** returned.

An interesting aspect of the season was the hosting of multiple Grands Prix on
the same track. **Red Bull Ring**, **Silverstone**, and **Bahrain** each hosted
two races under different names.

Overall, the 2020 season comprised 17 Grands Prix.

Ferrari** endured a challenging season with only three podiums, while **Albon,
